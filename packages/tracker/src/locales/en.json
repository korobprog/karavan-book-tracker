      "text": "By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – therefore, you should carefully read them before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of it, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you should not try to translate the app into other languages or create derivative versions. The app itself, and all trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Maksim Korobkov. Maksim Korobkov is committed to making the app as useful and efficient as possible. For this reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without clearly explaining to you what you are paying for. The BookTracker app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my services. You are responsible for keeping your phone and access to the app secure. Therefore, we recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware, compromise your phone's security features, and may cause the BookTracker app not to work properly or at all. The app does use third-party services that declare their own Terms. Link to the Terms of third-party service providers used by the app:",

      "addition": "You should be aware that there are certain things that Maksim Korobkov will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Maksim Korobkov cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi and you have no data allowance left. If you are using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, you should remember that the terms of your agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, your mobile network provider may charge you for data usage for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. By using the app, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, please be aware that we assume you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app. Similarly, Maksim Korobkov cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app, i.e., you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Maksim Korobkov cannot accept responsibility. Regarding Maksim Korobkov’s responsibility for your use of the app, it’s important to remember that, although we endeavor to ensure that it is always updated and correct, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Maksim Korobkov accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the app. At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you will need to download updates if you want to keep using the app. Maksim Korobkov does not promise that he will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app and (if needed) delete it from your device.",
